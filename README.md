#First Task - Read me file 

This repository about creating a control panel for the robot.
The control panel is responsible for initiating the values for the robot motors. 

Mainly the project contains 2 scripts. 
First one is the HTML script which determines the content of our Control Panel Web Page.
The second one is the PHP scripts which connect the HTML Page to our MySql Database.

The PHP Script is also responsible for saving the motors selected values to our database.
